# EVILGINX2_MODIFIED_PHISHLETS
This phishlets are modified and Fully Configured for evilginx2 
Evilginx2 – Fixed & Stabilized Phishlets (Secondary Source)
Overview
This repository contains restored, fixed, and stabilized Evilginx2 phishlets that were originally sourced from a secondary public collection often associated with simpler hacking–style repositories.
The original phishlets suffered from multiple critical issues that made them unreliable, partially broken, or completely unusable in real testing environments.
All issues have now been analyzed, corrected, and validated.
🔧 All fixes and stabilization work performed by: KhaninKali
What Was Broken (Before)
The original secondary-source phishlets had several serious problems, including:
❌ Invisible errors that caused silent failures
❌ Visible runtime errors inside Evilginx2
❌ Incorrect proxy_hosts definitions
❌ Broken sub_filters and malformed regex
❌ Invalid or outdated auth_tokens
❌ Incompatible YAML structure for newer Evilginx2 builds
❌ Sessions not being captured despite successful page loads
❌ Phishlets loading partially or not at all
These issues made the phishlets unreliable and unsafe for professional testing.
What Is Fixed (Now)
All phishlets in this repository are now:
✅ Fully compatible with Evilginx2
✅ Cleaned and normalized YAML structure
✅ Correct proxy_hosts and landing paths
✅ Fixed session handling logic
✅ Visible and invisible errors removed
✅ Tested for proper loading and execution
✅ Stable across multiple environments
⚙️ These are not rebranded copies — they are repaired and operational versions.
